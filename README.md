## 1. Introduction

Perplexity AI represents a new generation of search engines that combines traditional information retrieval with large language models to deliver direct, cited answers to user queries. This document details the technical journey of a query from the moment a user hits "Enter" to the delivery of a comprehensive, factual response.

## 2. User Query Processing Pipeline

### 2.1 Input Tokenization

When a user enters a query, the system first tokenizes the input using a combination of tokenization algorithms:

```
           +-----------------+
           | User Query Text |
           +-----------------+
                   |
                   v
+----------------+----------------------+----------------+
|                |                      |                |
| Byte-Pair      | WordPiece           | Morphological  |
| Encoding (BPE) | Tokenization        | Analysis       |
| for Latin      | for CJK languages   | for complex    |
| scripts        |                      | languages      |
|                |                      |                |
+----------------+----------------------+----------------+
                   |
                   v
           +-----------------+
           | Tokenized Query |
           +-----------------+
```

* **Primary Tokenization**: BPE (Byte-Pair Encoding) with a vocabulary size of 50,257 tokens for most western languages
* **Specialized Tokenizers**: 
  * WordPiece for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean with a vocabulary of 32,000 tokens
  * Morphological analyzers for languages with complex word structures (German, Finnish)
* **Token Handling**: Special tokens for handling URL patterns, code blocks, and mathematical expressions

### 2.2 Semantic Parsing

After tokenization, the query undergoes semantic parsing to understand intent and structure:

* **Grammar Framework**: HPSG (Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar) based parser
* **Intent Classification**: Classifies queries into 47 distinct semantic categories including:
  * Factual questions (who, what, when, where)
  * Procedural queries (how-to)
  * Comparative questions
  * Hypothetical scenarios
  * Multi-part complex queries
* **Entity Recognition**: Uses a proprietary NER system capable of identifying over 1.2M named entities with 97.8% accuracy

### 2.3 Query Preprocessing

Before routing to retrieval systems, queries undergo several preprocessing steps:

* **Unicode Normalization**: NFC (Normalization Form Canonical Composition)
* **Language Detection**: FastText-based model with 99.3% accuracy across 176 languages
* **Query Expansion**: Generation of 3-5 alternative phrasings using a fine-tuned T5-XXL model
* **Jargon Handling**: Technical terminology is mapped to a specialized domain-specific vocabulary database with over 10M technical terms
